To do list because i forget everything. Just put an x if it's done?

- Test Arduino Code on the Board
	-> Decide any additional features to add or change
	-> Decide if it's enough to meet the power/digital electronics 
- Decide how we will build the encoder
	-> Test
- Clean out system model 
	->Decide what we need for the initial POC system model
