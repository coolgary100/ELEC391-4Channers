To-Do:

Measure Step/Impulse Response - Feb 17th, Gary
Get the Transfer Function - Feb 17th, Gary (and zach)
	-> Pull out Inertia (J), Friction (B) and Spring (K) from the response we get from the motor
Model the system with the transfer function - Feb 19th, Zach
	-> Simulate moving the motor in Matlab
	-> Put Matlab system into Arduino
Define motor specifications - Feb 21st, Zach (and gary)
	-> Decide on the requirements for drawing with the motor
		-> How fast does it have to write an image
		-> What way is most efficient to draw (probably by line is easiest)
	-> Prelim calculations to determine restrictions
		-> size, windings, speed, acceleration, etc.
Start the Controls portion of the slide deck - Feb 16th, Zach
	-> Write up a quick outline of steps to completion
		-> Purpose, method, requirements, roles, etc.
	-> Review Stocco's site for information on slides
PID controller Feb 23, Zach & Gary
	-> Find appropriate PID values to make our motors follow the desired path Feb. 23
Put everything onto a protoboard Feb. 23+

Power everything from a 12V power supply (Extra-Feature)
	-> Proper voltage source with Power regulation
